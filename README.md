üîß Steps:
1. Go to: https://www.apachefriends.org
2. Download XAMPP for Windows.
3. Run the installer (xampp-win32-*.exe).
4. Follow the setup wizard and install.
5. Launch the XAMPP Control Panel and click Start next to Apache.

üîç Apache will now be running on http://localhost.

‚úÖ Option 2: Manual Apache Installation

üì• Step 1: Download Apache Binaries
Go to: https://www.apachelounge.com/download/
Download the latest Apache HTTP Server for Windows (httpd-*.zip).

üìÇ Step 2: Extract Files
Extract the ZIP file to a folder, e.g., C:\Apache24.

‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Install Apache as a Service
Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

Run this command:
cd \Apache24\bin
httpd.exe -k install

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 4: Start Apache
httpd.exe -k start

Visit http://localhost in your browser to verify Apache is running.
‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
If port 80 is in use (e.g., by Skype or IIS), Apache may fail to start.

You can change the port in httpd.conf:
Listen 8080
Then access it via http://localhost:8080.
